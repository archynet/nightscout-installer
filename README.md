Tutorial and all-in-one script to install and update [Nightscout](https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor) on Ubuntu and Debian Linux distributions on web servers. To access the local Pi from the internet or at least to renew letsencrypt certificates regularly, port forwarding or firewall rule adjustments in the home router are required.
